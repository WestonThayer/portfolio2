                    <p>I work in the Windows design studio at Microsoft, helping define the next generation of the <strong>Windows 10 design language</strong> through core controls &amp; patterns.</p>
                    <p>I’ve studied user-centered design at the <em>University of Washington</em> and have a BS in Computer Science from Virginia Tech.</p>
                    <p>My work draws from minimalism and simplicity. My secret weapon is code.</p>
                    <p>I’ve been working on digital products for over 6 years.</p>
                    <p>Back in 2004, when I had just started my career, sIFR was the hottest thing out there. It was developed by Shaun Inman and it embedded custom fonts in a small Flash movie, which could be utilized with a little bit of JavaScript and CSS. At the time, it was basically the only way to use custom fonts in browsers like Firefox or Safari. The fact that this technique relied on Flash soon made it obsolete, with the release of the iPhone (without flash) in 2007.</p>
