A design system for Windows phones, tablets, PCs, and Xbox. From buttons and checkboxes to app bars and pivots, every control works with touch, mouse, keyboard, pen, and even Xbox controllers.

The controls were a core part of the next step for the Microsoft Design Language (formerly known as Metro) as it expanded to encompass more devices. We carefully iterated to find a density that didn't feel too loose with mouse, but at the same time weren't too small to touch.
