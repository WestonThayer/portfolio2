Optimizing Zapier's upgrade experience to be simple and transparent.

Zapier is a powerful automation tool that connects apps (like Gmail, Trello, or Dropbox) to make them work together in ways that would otherwise be impossible. The automations Zapier customers create are called Zaps, which are created using the Zap Editor.

Everyone gets a free 2 week trial, but once that expires you may have to upgrade to a paid plan to create more Zaps in the Editor.

Working on Zapier's first growth team, we looked for experiences in the product that could be improved to impact core business goals, like upgrades to paid plans. As part of our discovery process, we looked at all the different paths someone could take in order to upgrade. We found that to upgrade your account from the Zap Editor required visiting 9 different screens, with multiple opportunities to get confused or lost.

I reduced that experience into a single modal that shows in the Zap Editor. The design keeps you in context of your original goal (turn on this Zap), clearly explains why an upgrade is required, and suggests only the cheapest possible plan needed to continue. This resulted in a 75% increase in upgrades.
