A redesign of drag and drop for Windows 10 to bring the magic back to one of Window's original features.

Elegant transitions give touch users clear indication of when they can drag. Responsive reorder animations provide clarity and a degree of delight to the interaction.

Rapidly iterating on high-fidelity prototypes was essential to discovering the best solution.

{{> post-figure--video
    src="/assets/work/drag-and-drop/ctx.mp4"
    loop="true"
    caption="Press and hold is still used to show a context menu after a slightly longer hold. Moving the item hides the menu to let you continue the drag."
}}

{{> post-figure--video
    src="/assets/work/drag-and-drop/multiple.mp4"
    loop="true"
    caption="Multiple items can be dragged, even reordered"
}}

While drag and drop is most frequently used in lists, the design also works well in grids of items.
