A marketing concept to promote Qualcomm's line of [Snapdragon processors](http://www.qualcomm.com/snapdragon) for Android phones. Snapdragon's were some of the first mobile processors capable of smoothly rendering augmented reality. A child could point their smartphone's camera at a special tag on the cereal box. An animation leaps out of the box letting them know if they've won a prize, or let's them play an augmented reality game if not.
