At work, I started a C++/Cx repository in [Visual Studio Online](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/what-is-visual-studio-online-vs.aspx). I needed an easy way for consumers to read about the public APIs.

*tldr: UI frameworks should stop putting type in a box because it's counter to the design intent and doesn't withstand localization. I've created a prototype implementation of the TextLine paradigm in XAML.*
